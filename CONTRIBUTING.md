# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Cashier. Bug reports, fixes and new provider features are all welcome.

## Getting started

You need Node.js 20 or later and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fellahealth/cashier.git
cd cashier
npm install
```

## Scripts

| Command                 | What it does                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build`         | Builds every package to its own dist/ |
| `npm test`              | Runs the Jest test suite              |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Runs the tests with a coverage report |
| `npm run typecheck`     | Type checks the source and tests      |
| `npm run lint`          | Lints with ESLint                     |
| `npm run format`        | Formats every file with Prettier      |
| `npm run format:check`  | Checks formatting without writing     |

Run every script from the repository root. Run `npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build` before you open a pull request. CI runs the same checks on Node.js 20 and 22.

## Project layout

The repository is an npm workspaces monorepo. Every folder in `packages/` is published to npm as its own package.

| Folder             | npm package                     | Contents                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/cashier` | `@aios-medical/cashier`         | The core library and drivers                         |
| `packages/nestjs`  | `@aios-medical/cashier-nestjs`  | NestJS module, `CashierService` and exception filter |
| `packages/express` | `@aios-medical/cashier-express` | Express middleware and error handler                 |

Inside a package:

- `src/` holds the code. In `packages/cashier`, each provider lives in `src/drivers/<provider>/` with its resources, mappers and error mapper.
- `tests/` mirrors `src/` and uses mocked provider clients, so no network access or API keys are needed.
- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and `tsup.config.ts` hold the package's own settings. Linting, formatting, testing and the shared TypeScript options live at the root.

Documentation for every package lives in `docs/` at the root. The root `README.md` is the npm page of `@aios-medical/cashier`, and the other packages have their own `README.md`. The root `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md` (and the root `README.md` for `packages/cashier`) are copied into each package when it is packed, so do not edit the copies.

In the repository, the NestJS and Express packages use the source of `@aios-medical/cashier` directly, through the TypeScript `paths` and Jest `moduleNameMapper` settings. Their peer dependency on `@aios-medical/cashier` is set to the release version when a release is published.

## Adding a driver

Each provider is a driver in `packages/cashier/src/drivers/<provider>/`. The Stripe and Recurly drivers are the reference: copy the structure of the one closest to your provider.

1. Add a member to the `CashierProvider` enum (for example `Paddle = 'paddle'`) and the provider's options to `CashierProviderOptions` in `packages/cashier/src/types/cashier.types.ts`.
2. Create the driver folder:
   - `<provider>.driver.ts`: a class that implements `CashierDriver` and creates the five resources.
   - `resources/`: one class per resource, implementing `CustomersResource`, `InvoicesResource`, `ProductsResource`, `PricesResource` and `SubscriptionsResource`.
   - `mappers/`: functions that turn the provider's objects into Cashier's `Customer`, `Invoice`, `Product`, `Price` and `Subscription`.
   - `<provider>-error.mapper.ts` and `<provider>-request.ts`: map every provider error to a `CashierError` subclass, and wrap every call with that mapping.
3. Register the driver in `createDriver` in `packages/cashier/src/drivers/create-driver.ts`.
4. Add the provider's official SDK to `peerDependencies` in `packages/cashier/package.json`, and to `devDependencies` in the root `package.json`.
5. Add tests in `packages/cashier/tests/<provider>/` with a mocked SDK client, like the existing `tests/fixtures/*-client.mock.ts`. No network access or real API keys.
6. Document it: add a column for the provider to each resource page in `docs/`, the error mapping in `docs/errors.md`, and a row to the Providers table in `README.md`.

When the provider has no equivalent for a method, reject with `UnsupportedOperationError`, as the Recurly driver does for prices. Follow the conventions in [Drivers and conventions](docs/drivers.md#conventions): amounts in minor units, uppercase currency codes, `Date` timestamps, and `status: 'unknown'` for states Cashier does not know.

## Guidelines

- Keep the public API the same for every provider. When a provider cannot support an operation, reject with `UnsupportedOperationError`.
- Map every provider error to a `CashierError` subclass. Never let a raw provider error escape.
- Return amounts in minor units and currency codes in uppercase.
- Add or update tests for every change in behavior.
- Keep code free of comments and JSDoc. Document behavior in `docs/` instead, and keep the README short.
- Use neutral example data in tests, such as `pro-monthly` or `customer-42`.

## Commits and pull requests

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), for example `feat: add coupons resource` or `fix(recurly): map expired card errors`.

Keep pull requests focused on one change and describe what you changed and why. If you squash merge, make sure the pull request title is a Conventional Commit too, since it becomes the commit message on `main`.

## Releases

Releases are fully automated with [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/). Every push to `main` runs the Release workflow, which runs all checks and then reads the commits since the last release to decide the next version:

| Commit                                              | Release                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `fix: ...`, `perf: ...` or `docs: ...`              | Patch, for example 0.1.1 |
| `feat: ...`                                         | Minor, for example 0.2.0 |
| `feat!: ...` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer         | Major, for example 1.0.0 |
| `chore`, `ci`, `test`, `build`, `refactor`, `style` | No release               |

When there is something to release, the workflow creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag, publishes a GitHub Release with notes generated from the commits, and publishes every package in `packages/` to npm under [`@aios-medical`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/aios-medical) with provenance. All packages are released together with the same version. Nothing is committed back to the repository, so the `version` in each `package.json` stays at `0.0.0-development`. The published version comes from the tag.

`docs` commits publish a patch because npm only updates the README shown on npmjs.com when a new version is published. Use `chore` for changes that should not be released, such as typo fixes in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Never bump the version or publish by hand.
